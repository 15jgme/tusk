# Tuskâš¡
[![Go](https://github.com/15jgme/tusk/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/15jgme/tusk/actions/workflows/go.yml)

A lightweight and (eventually) pretty cli tool for updating docker container instances. Written in Go using BubbleTea.

If you're deploying containers onto a single server and don't want to remember which ports go with which image when you pull new images and restart your containers, this tool is for you.

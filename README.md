# Tuskâš¡

A lightweight and (eventually) pretty cli tool for updating docker container instances. Written in Go using BubbleTea.

If you're deploying containers onto a single server and don't want to remember which ports go with which container when you pull new images and restart your containers, this tool is for you.
